Sorry, Agent <agent_name> you did not answer the question correctly.

Overall, you should never share your password with anyone. But while you are
still in school, it is okay to share your password with your parents.

Even though you like your friends and your teachers, it is not a good idea to
share your passwords with them.
The more people who know your password, the more unsafe your secret is.

And you should never, ever share your password with a stranger.
