This challenge is about Encryption.

Hello again Agent <agent_name>!

This challenge is about Encryption.

Encrypting a message means translating it to a code that is hard
for a spy to read. To encrypt it, you use the key to convert
each letter into a different letter.

To make it readable again, you use that same key to convert
the coded letter back to the original letter.

In this challenge, you will be asked to solve an encryption puzzle
to protect your secret message from the spies!

Good luck!
