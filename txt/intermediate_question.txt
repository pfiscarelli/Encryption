To solve this challenge, use the Caesar Cipher code wheel to decrypt
the encoded message.

You will be given the encryption key to set the Caesar Cipher wheel.
Turn the wheel so that 'A' aligns with the 'Key' letter. Then use
the code wheel to decrypt each letter of the encrypted message.

To decrypt the encrypted message, work from the inside wheel to
the outside wheel.

Use the mouse, or left and right arrow keys to move the code wheel.

Click 'Submit' when you have decrypted the encoded message.
